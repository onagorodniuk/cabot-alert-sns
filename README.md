Cabot Skeleton Alert Plugin
=====

This is the skeleton alert plugin for Cabot. This is a sufficient launch pad for almost all Cabot alert plugins. See [writing plugins](http://cabotapp.com/dev/writing-plugins.html) for a guide on how to use it. Don't hesitate to open an issue on the official cabot github in order to ask *intelligent* questions.
